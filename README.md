# <a name="#Work"></a>What I am working on
I am currently working on a short game which is a school project called [Sonic's Eduquest](https://github.com/ZaBlazzingZeif/SonicEduquest).
I have also remade [my Plants vs. Zombies 2 level maker](https://github.com/ZaBlazzingZeif/LevelEditor) this summer as a graduation project for my programming courses. It is going to be updated to `2.1` in a short while.

Later on, when I am more of less free, I am planning to learn more of game development. I think my go-to will be `C++20` because it is modern, fast and you can do some extraordinary things with it.

I might also update this page later as right now it feels a bit empty for my liking.

# <a name="#Contact"></a>Contact me
I am currently somewhat inactive on the web except for GitHub, but you can always contact me via Discord. I am freely available on it for the vast majority of time and I try to reply as soon as I can.
My tag is **ZaBlazzingZeif#4504**.

If you want to collab with me on a certain project, well, I am in for it, but remember that I am busy for the most part at the time being unfortunately.
But regardless of that, if you just feel like chatting with me I guess it is worth a shot and I definitely will not ignore you.
